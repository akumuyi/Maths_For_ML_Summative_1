# TV Marketing Sales Prediction

This project demonstrates building a linear regression model to predict sales based on TV marketing expenses.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to predict sales based on TV marketing expenses using different machine learning techniques, including:

* Linear Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests
* Gradient Descent Optimization

## Results

The project compares the performance of different scikit learn models using RMSE and ranks them accordingly.
and finally implementing gradient descent from scratch which does better than the rest of the previous
scikit-learn models

## Dataset

The project uses the `tvmarketing.csv` dataset, containing TV marketing expenses and sales data.

## Implementation

The project uses Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for data analysis, visualization, and model building.
and finally a final implementation of gradient descent from scratch.

## Usage

1. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the models in notebooks folder.
